# Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data

This project focuses on **analyzing sentiment in social media content** using deep learning techniques, specifically an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model. It provides insights into whether a post or comment expresses a **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiment.

## 📌 Project Overview

With the massive growth of social media platforms, analyzing user sentiment has become essential for businesses, researchers, and developers. This project builds a pipeline for:

- Data preprocessing and text cleaning
- Tokenization and padding
- Model building using an LSTM neural network
- Sentiment prediction and performance evaluation

## 📁 Files

- `Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the entire code pipeline from data loading to model evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 🧠 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Keras / TensorFlow
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- NLTK for text preprocessing

## ⚙️ Model Architecture

The LSTM model consists of:

- Embedding layer for word representation
- LSTM layer for capturing sequential patterns
- Dense layers for classification
- Output layer with softmax activation (for multi-class sentiment classification)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is a labeled collection of social media texts (tweets/posts) annotated with sentiment labels. *(You can mention the exact dataset name/source if applicable.)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-social-media.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-social-media
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   Open `Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

## ✅ Output

The model evaluates sentiment in each input text and classifies it as:
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

It also provides training/validation accuracy and loss graphs for performance monitoring.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Integration with live Twitter/Facebook API
- Add BERT or transformer-based models for better accuracy
- Support for multilingual sentiment analysis
